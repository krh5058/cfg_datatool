Update for cfg_datatool (2/27/14)

Issues at hand:
1) I apologize for the late report.  I have had many other projects that pulled my attention in multiple directions, and I have not had enough time to sit down and program for sufficient amounts of time.  The complexity behind this project requires a lot of effort in keeping many moving parts in mind at one time, and I need a decent amount of time to organize before I can even begin to code.  In the short sessions I have had time for, I have made decent progress, but not enough to meet our discussed deadline of Monday, Mar. 3rd.  To dedicate enough time for your project, I will need to extend our deadline.  If possible, I would like to continue to meet to give you on-going progress, which I hope has been worthwhile.  Additionally, it helps me relay the (many) hurdles in making a quality, bug-free UI.  I've made efforts with Rick (CC'd here) to organize priorities, manage workflow, and allow for more time to dedicate to programming.

2) Additionally, I apologize for not preparing a UI mock-up and usage report this week.  Besides lack of time, most of the programming done since last time I met with your team has been primarily back-end development, debugging, and addressing user interface dead-ends (situations where the user or the interface cannot continue to function because the specific order of input commands has not been explicitly addressed).

3) Please let me know when you are next available to meet, and I will try my best to prepare some visual materials for you to evaluate by then.

Completed:
- Implemented a range slider to ILAB plot window.
- Developed UI accessories for confirmation/cancel and other interface events
- Modification of UI controls to account for user backtracking and other potential interface issues
- Synchronized saccade plotting with trial and slider effects
- Adjusted data table for better interface experience
- Clarified velocity calculation algorithms

Primary Milestones:
- Complete Add/Modify saccade functions
- Add a "Clear" selected saccade function, in case of erroneous input
- Implement trial parameters import, relay specs to client
- Implement algorithms for latency and distance calculations
- Run custom saccade selections with ILAB velocity calculations
- Deliver new UI mock-up and demonstrate usage in current state.

Secondary Milestones:
- Implement "Plot all" function
- Add Save/Load CFG parameter functionality
- Modify "Error" check-box to un-sync between initial/final saccade
- Organize analysis documentation, include as help text
- Finalize menu-bar items
- Debug and quality control of current interface functions
